Q: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
A:
- Case 1: passing object is an instance of a child class of Media -> the method functions normally because the object is still be considered an instance of Media.
- Case 2: passing object is not an instance of a child class of Media -> the method will catch an error at casting stage, therefor return false.
