Q: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
A:
- Case 1: passing object is an instance of a child class of Media
-> the method functions normally because the object is still be considered an instance of Media.
- Case 2: passing object is not an instance of a child class of Media
-> the method will catch an error at casting stage, therefor return false.

Q: Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe what happens and explain in detail.
A:
- Case 1: toString() is overrided in child classes of Media
-> When toString() is called, the particular toString() with corresponding to the class of the current object will be called.
- Case 2: toString() is not overrided in child classes of Media and toString() is overrided in Media
-> When toString() is called, the method toString() of the parent class will be called. If its parent class is Media, then the method toString() in Media is called. If its parent class is a child class of Media, then if its parent class has overrided toString() method, this method will be called, otherwise the toString() method of Media will be called.
- Case 3: toString() is not overrided in Media and its child class.
-> When toString() is called, because all classes by default is a child of Object class, then this class's toString() method will be called if its children's toString() method has not been overrided yet. This method will return a String including the class name, its packages and its hexadecimal hashcode.
